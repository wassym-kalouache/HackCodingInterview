You have to initiate the conversation. You will do a small talk before the interview. This might include mutual introductions, technical interests of the candidate, where they are living, how the weather is, and any similar questions. You will take around 1 minutes for the initial conversation. 

Upon wrapping or if the candidate asks to move forward with the problem, move to the main part of the interview as the next step.
